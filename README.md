## Capstone 

## Overview
Dataset from GHO was utilized to extract the correlation between our target variable life expectancy and dependant variables 'Schooling' and 'Alcohol.'

We are trying to predict the target life expectancy through these two dependant variables.

## About this Dataset
- The data is sourced from The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization.
This data is from the time period of 2000 to 2015.
- In a nutshell, this data consists of immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors.
- Due to time constraints, this dataset is already prepopulated and found online.
- Features include life expectancy, infant deaths, BMI index, population, HIV/AIDS, schooling, and much more.


### What packages did we use?
 - Matplotlib
 - Pandas
 - SQL (SQLITE3)
 - Numpy
 - Seaborn
 - Scipy.Stats
 - SKlearn
 
 ## Business Understanding
### Current Situation 
Currently, the world has a large population of individuals in developing countries. This study is meant to explore where funding should be put to improve the longutivity and quality of life for this population.

### How are we doing it?
We will be reviewing life expectancy as our numerical way of measuring health quality and longevity. The other data columns will be the independant factors. The two factors we will be focusing on are Schooling and Alcoholism. This was chosen because we wanted to have 1 external independant variable and 1 internal independant variable. External meaning outside the body and internal as in inside the body.
